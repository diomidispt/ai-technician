"""Split document text into embed-sized chunks, preserving page + section for citations.

Strategy: respect natural boundaries. Split a page into paragraphs, then pack whole paragraphs
(or sentences, for long ones) into chunks up to a target size, carrying a short overlap so an
answer that straddles a boundary is still retrievable. This beats blind fixed-width cuts, which
slice mid-sentence and hurt both retrieval and citation quality.

We also track the nearest **section heading** while walking the text and attach it to each chunk
(and prefix the chunk content with it), so retrieval has structural context and citations can say
"page 109, section 5.2 Drum motor" instead of just a page number.
